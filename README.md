## Full Stack Open 2019 / 2020 / 2021
An open university course organised by University of Helsinki, focusing on modern web development technologies (JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js,MongoDB, and GraphQL). 

This repository is divided into the different parts of the course, each part containing multiple apps. Most of the commits are a full implementation for a single exercise (not the best convention, w/e) found on the course [website](https://fullstackopen.com/). This repository is mainly used for studying, and is not organised to show off the code (which is not necessarily of the best quality).
